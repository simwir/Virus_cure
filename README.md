How to use this mod

1. Open your mods folder.

The easiest way to find it is to open your saves in game, then go to the saves folder and go one folder up.

2. When you have located your mods folder locate this mod. now this will be a bit tricky as the mod names gets replaced with numbers. But if you open one of the numbered folders and then open the data then if there are a jar called "Virus_cure.jar" that's the right folder.
